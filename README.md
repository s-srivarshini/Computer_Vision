# Computer Vision 

## Contents
**Computer Vision Toolkit**: A collection of Python scripts designed for executing a wide range of computer vision tasks using libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and SciPy.
**Revolutionizing Neurosurgical Guidance in Real-Time**: A research paper discussing the integration of real-time imaging and computer vision technologies to improve neurosurgical interventions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
#### Using the Toolkit
Each script in the computer vision toolkit is standalone and can be executed to perform specific vision tasks, from basic image processing to advanced object detection in video streams.

To run the notebook and replicate the findings, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
```

#### Reading the Paper
The PDF paper can be viewed using any standard PDF reader. It is recommended for those interested in the latest advancements in neurosurgical technologies and the application of AI and computer vision in medicine.
